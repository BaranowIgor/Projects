        <div class="project-description">
          <p>I have created innovative tool that goes beyond traditional box stacking calculators, offering a sophisticated solution for optimizing pallet space. Through the utilization of advanced algorithms, my application excels in optimizing box placement, far outperforming similar calculators from competitors by accommodating a significantly greater number of boxes on each pallet. My app dynamically rotates and positions boxes to find the most efficient layout, even exploring multi-directional stacking when needed. This means you can pack more boxes onto your pallets than ever before, ultimately saving time, space, and resources. Plus, error-proof design ensures that incorrect inputs, such as oversized boxes or excessive weight, are instantly flagged, guaranteeing the integrity of your palletization process. </p>

      <h3>REDUCED TRANSPORTATION BY 833 KM PER DAY</h3>
      <div class="project reduced-transportation">
        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            I searched the database of stores and which DCs are currently serviced and found stores that are not serviced by the nearest DC. But it was not possible to simply assign an additional, closer store to DC. So I was looking for dependencies between DC pairs that could potentially swap stores and thus cover fewer kilometers. After such a search, I found 8 DC pairs with 56 store exchanges that saved 833 km of transportation per day.

      <h3>DETAILED DOCUMENTATION FOR THE NEW DISTRIBUTION CENTER</h3>
      <div class="project project-documentation">
        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            I played an active role in the establishment of distribution centers. My responsibilities included generating comprehensive documentation that covered everything about the center, from its location to detailing the operations occurring within it.<br>
            But the challenge was that I didn't have the data to do it. All I got was information that I was now the assistant director of this center and a list of contacts. And I was already building a network of contacts to get full information about every process in this center. For example, I received a ground plan of the center and therefore contacted individual departments and persons to collect quantitative data and detailed information about the processes and then described the processes on this plan. For example, I create diagram explaining the main processes and the flow process of refrigerated containers.

      <div class="project project-warehous">
        <div class="project-description">
          <p>Based on data on the plot area, maximum height of the building, products to be stored, load weight (tons/year), number of working days in the warehouse, number of work shifts per day, duration of one shift, load inspection time and others, I designed a build-to-suit warehouse and the processes taking place in this center<br>
          <ul>
            <li>I calculated the daily supply stream, min. stock, cyclical stock, max. stock</li>
            <li>I chose the most suitable storage methods (ABC, LIFO, FIFO) and racks for each method. Calculated the parameters of the racks to store the planned amount of goods</li>
            <li>Then types and number of forklifts were selected, where all parameters were also taken into account (max distance of the forlift, time of driving empty forklift forward and backward, time of pick up of the load, load placement time, maximum lifting height, lifting time for forks with load/without load, lowering time with/without load, time of one turn)</li>
            <li>All the distances and the number of turns that each forklift must make were calculated.</li>

        <div class="project-description">
          <p>While studying as an exchange student in Slovenia, I completed an interesting project on analysing transportation chain of a small growing company that sell whiskey and calculated the required resources for the chain.<br>
            For their annual whiskey transportation plan I calculated the required quantity of pallets, vans in the work place and vans in the inventory park, forklifts, containers in work and in inventory, semitrailers, railway vehicles and port crane.

            Here you can immediately see where stagnation occurs and where it is important to change something so that get rid of "bottlenecks" within the logistics workflow. <br>

Which packages should the car take to maximize the cargo's value? <br>b. The car has a load capacity of 25 and must take packages 1 and 6. Which packages should the car take to maximize the cargo's value? <br>c. The car has a load capacity of 25 and cannot take both packages 1 and 2 simultaneously. <br>Which packages should the car take to maximize the cargo's value?</p>

            During my internship, I made a map that visually shows which stores are connected to which distribution centers as well as all the changes that will occur after the opening of the new center. The new center will not take all the stores at once, it will take them in stages and with each such stage there is a change in all centers throughout Poland, which is also clearly visible on the map I made.

      <h3>MARKETING AND LOGISTICS FUNCTION OF PACHAGING</h3>
      <div class="project project-marketing">
        <div class="project-description">
          <p>I examined the marketing function of packaging as a key element of consumer purchasing decisions.<br> 
            I assumed that there is a trend towards minimalism and that changing the packaging to a more minimalist one could increase product sales. I made a simplified and very minimalistic packaging for some popular products and did research on which product the customer would choose and what information on the packaging most attracts them. <br>
            Also explored the importance of the logistics function of packaging.
